                    <p className="font-bold text-[26px] mt-[60px]">Do fillers hurt?</p>
                    <p>
                        Prior to treatment you are numbed with hospital grade numbing cream and also injected with filler that contains lidocaine for extra comfort. Most people feel a slight pressure and slight scratching sensation at most. If you are sensitive to pain you can get EMLA numbing cream from the Pharmacy and apply this in a very thick layer 15 minutes prior to your appointment. Paracetamol can also be taken 30 minutes before your appointment.
                    </p>
                    <p className="font-bold text-[26px] mt-[60px]">How much filler do I need?</p>
                    <p>
                        It depends because it is so personalised to your features and desired result. However 1ml is recommended for first time fillers to build that initial layer and then another session a month later to build up that volume in the lips. Most clients find that they need 2-3 layers before the filler builds up leaving you with a fuller look. If going for a very subtle enhancement I would recommend 0.5ml over 2-3 sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p className="font-bold text-[26px] mt-[60px]">How long do fillers last?</p>
                    <p>
                        You can expect to see results lasting anything from 9 months to a year and a half. When first getting filler a minimum of two- three sessions is recommended to build a nice level of filler. Sunbeds, exercise and having a fast metabolism are all known to break down filler quicker which may mean having top ups more regularly. Once you have reached your desired volume you can maintain with a top up every 6-12 months if necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p className="font-bold text-[26px] mt-[60px]">Can filler be removed?</p>
                    <p>
                        The beauty of the hyaluronic acid dermal fillers is that thereâ€™s a product called hyaluronidase, which is an enzyme that can quickly be injected to immediately dissolve the dermal filler. Its a quick process and the product starts to immediately break down the filler.
                    </p>
                    <p className="font-bold text-[26px] mt-[60px]">What is the recovery time for dermal fillers?</p>
                    <p>
                        Every patient's recovery time is different after any procedure. Typically lip swelling after filler will significantly decrease after 2-3 days but for some patients it may last as long as 5-7 days. Any swelling or bruising should be completely gone by two weeks. We recommend that you increase your water in-take before and after injection. Immediately after your treatment you may notice needle marks, tenderness and asymmetry, these issues are common and will settle in a few days to weeks.
                    </p>
                    <p className="font-bold text-[26px] mt-[60px]">How long does tear troph filler last?</p>
                    <p>
                        On average, it can last for up to 12 months, however this depends on the individual's lifestyle, age and skin type. Redensity II attracts less water than most Hyaluronic Acid gel and is done via cannula technique to prevent trauma and bruising , so minimal swelling is present after treatment. Tear troph cannot be booked as part of a contour package.
                    </p>
                    <p className="font-bold text-[26px] mt-[60px]">What is Aqualyx?</p>
                    <p>
                        Aqualyx is a safe, fat dissolving injection treatment that reduces fat cells in the treated area. It produces long lasting results and can be used to treat small ,exercise resistant pockets of fat around the chin , chest , back, love handles ,abdomen , thighs , knees and ankles. 3-5 sessions are recommend and results can usually be seen by the second/third sessions.
